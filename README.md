## Blackjack in JavaScript

Just teaching myself some more Javascript with the apparently-standard "write a Blackjack game".

## Testing
You'll need to have NODE.js installed. Then you can run tests with `npm test`. To view a local version of the game, run `http-server`.

## Working Version
A more or less working copy of this code is [here](https://amberwilkie.github.io/blackjack-js/).
